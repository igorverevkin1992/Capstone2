    "In this notebook we will perform preprocessing and training data development for the project. The goal of this process is to standardize our model development dataset. It includes encoding categorical variables, scaling numeric features and splitting the dataset into train and test sets. Since we have already performed data encoding in the previous step (EDA), we don't have to do it again. There is also no need to perform scaling because our features are categorical (except 'age' column, which is numeric).\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the previous steps that our dataset consists mostly of binary features. We also determined that the problem we're trying to solve is a classification problem - classifying patients as 'positive' (have diabetes) or 'negative' (does not have diabetes). In this step we will build and train a baseline model - in this case it will be Logistic Regression model, which is good for classification problems. We will also check another model - Random Forest - in order to compare it with Logistic Regression model and see which of them perform better."

We stratified our train and test splits so they have the same proportion of 'positive' and 'negative' cases. After splitting the data we built LogisticRegression model and evaluated it performance. The model showed no significant gaps on train and test sets, indicating there were no over-/underfitting. Then we build RandomForestClassifier model and evaluated its performance on test set. This model outperformed out baseline model and showed better precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy."
